# Pet Image Classifier

This project provides a simple Python script for image classification using pre-trained models from PyTorch (ResNet, AlexNet, VGG) on ImageNet. The script takes an image and a model name as input, performs image processing, applies the specified pre-trained model, and returns the predicted class label.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Pillow (PIL)

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision pillow
```

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pree46/Image-classifier-project
cd Image-Classifier-project
cd home
```

## Models used
